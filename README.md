# Stochastic Modeling in Finance

## Project Structure
This repository is organized into several Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a different aspect of financial modeling and option pricing. Here is an overview of the contents:

- **Part I: Analytical Option Formulae.ipynb**
  - This notebook provides the mathematical foundation for option pricing, including closed-form solutions and analytical methods used as benchmarks in later sections.

- **Part II: Model Calibration.ipynb**
  - Focuses on calibrating the S&P 500 option prices using displaced-diffusion and SABR models. It includes fitting the model parameters to market data to ensure accurate representation of market behaviors.

- **Part III: Static Replication.ipynb**
  - Explores the concept of static replication to mimic the payoff of options through a portfolio of other financial instruments, providing insights into constructing synthetic positions.

- **Part IV: Dynamic Hedging.ipynb**
  - Discusses and implements dynamic hedging strategies to manage the risks associated with holding options over time, adjusting the hedge as market conditions change.
